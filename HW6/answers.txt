2. (1Gb/s)*RTT/(mss bytes) = window size
3. No, if one connection dominates and which connection will drop connections is non-deterministic, both connection will remain roughly at the same relative rates

5. 2RTT+OT/R+(k-1)(ST/R+RTT)-(2^P-1)ST/R
6. Yes, assuming the window size is not sufficiently small to negate the problem, if a file over 4GB is sent over a very fast but very high-latency connection, say pushing a software update to a future Mars rover. Assume the sequence number starts at 1, eventually wraps around and hits 1 again. If a packet is lost for a sequence number that has been hit more than once, we won't know which actual packet it was because that sequence number has occurred more than once.
