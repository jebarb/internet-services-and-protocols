2. (1Gb/s)*RTT/(mss bytes) = window size
3. No, if one connection dominates and which connection will drop connections is non-deterministic, both connection will remain roughly at the same relative rates

5. 2RTT+OT/R+(k-1)(ST/R+RTT)-(2^P-1)ST/R
6. Yes, assuming the window size is not sufficiently small to negate the problem, if a file over 4GB is sent over a very fast but very high-latency connection, say pushing a software update to a future Mars rover. Assume the sequence number starts at 1, eventually wraps around and hits 1 again. If a packet is lost for a sequence number that has been hit more than once, we won't know which actual packet it was because that sequence number has occurred more than once.
7. From RFC 2001: "It is assumed that if there is just a reordering of the segments, there will be only one or two duplicate ACKs before the reordered segment is processed, which will then generate a new ACK.  If three or more duplicate ACKs are received in a row, it is a strong indication that a segment has been lost.  TCP then performs a retransmission of what appears to be the missing segment, without waiting for a retransmission timer to expire."
   Receiving one or two duplicate packets is not a good indication of packet loss as it could be a simple reordering, but receiving three or more duplicates is a good indication of a lost segment.
